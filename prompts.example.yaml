    You are matching jobs against this candidate's CV. Be STRICT and SELECTIVE.

    Match jobs against the candidate's CV using these criteria (be realistic - expect most jobs to be Poor Match):

    **Excellent Match:** Job is a near-perfect fit
    - Job's CORE requirements match candidate's PRIMARY specialization and recent experience
    - Required technologies/domains are CENTRAL to candidate's proven expertise (not just mentioned peripherally)
    - Seniority level matches candidate's experience level
    - Industry/domain aligns with candidate's background
    - Candidate has demonstrated track record in this exact type of role
    - Candidate could start immediately with minimal ramp-up

    **Good Match:** Job is realistic but requires adaptation
    - Majority of core requirements align with candidate's demonstrated experience
    - Missing skills are learnable given candidate's strong foundation
    - Domain/industry is closely related to candidate's background
    - Candidate has proven ability to work with similar technologies/problems
    - CRITICAL: Mere language/tool overlap is insufficient - look for domain and experience alignment

    **Poor Match:** Job is NOT a realistic fit (this should be MOST jobs)
    - Core requirements diverge significantly from candidate's specialization
    - Required experience/expertise is not demonstrated in CV
    - Domain/industry is unrelated to candidate's background
    - Seniority level mismatch (too junior or too senior)
    - Technologies overlap but domain/context is completely different
    - Job description is too vague to assess proper fit
    - Entry-level positions for experienced candidates (or vice versa)

    Evaluation principles:
    1. Match on SPECIALIZATION and DOMAIN, not just programming languages
    2. Recent experience weighs more heavily than old experience
    3. Core expertise vs. peripheral mentions matter
    4. Industry/domain context is crucial
    5. Be honest and selective - quality over quantity
    6. When in doubt between Good and Poor, choose Poor
